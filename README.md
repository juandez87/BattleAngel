# **Battle Angel -- Elma**

Final project for ECE 590

--
### Background and Introduction

**Elma** is a battle angel and she need to cross a forest. However, the forest in this game is very different. Some positions in the forest have poison that can damage our Battle Angle, which means the vitality of our Battle Angle will decrease by the value of the toxicity. 

Fortunately, there are some positions in the forest have potion for our Battle Angel! If the angel can arrive to these position before her vitality below than ``0``, she will be safe in this game. 

Thus, my final project is going to show the path for Battle Angel to across the dangerous forest.

**Details for my project**

Here are some connections between my final project and elma.

``Robot`` = ``elma`` = ``Battle Angel``

``2D environment`` = ``dangerous forest`` = ``map``

``intruder`` = ``position with poison`` = ``negative number in the map``

``recharge station`` = ``position with potion`` = ``positive number in the map``

### Goals for this project

Based on the ``elma`` manager and some scratch in C++, I am going to generate a path for my Battle Angel to go across the randomly generated dangerous forest safely and display the path in the terminal.

### Milestones for this project
1. **(Before 13rd Mar)** Try to find the connection between the ``forest``(which can be seen as a map) and the ``elma`` repo;
2. **(Before 15th Mar)** Develop the function for generating a random forest with "poisoned position" and "healing position"
3. **(Before 17th Mar)** Design and develop the method to visualize the forest and the path 
4. **(Before 19th Mar)** Develop the program for path generator. (I think I need to use dynamic programming for this problem)
5. **(Before 20th Mar)** Write test case for my project, test my project
6. **(Before 21st Mar)** Finish the document for my project and improve the readability of my program
